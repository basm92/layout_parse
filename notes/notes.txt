Control variables:
    Temperature
    Precipitation
    Land Suitability
    Elevation
    Latitude
    Longitude
    Area
    Distance to Coast / Harbor
    Population / Population Density at t0

Dependent variables:
    Count
    Dummy > 0
    Ranking
    Diversification and Complexity

Placebo Test:
    Need Austrian Patent Data - Should see a drop in patents after independence Veneto/Lombardy
    Complementary: Piedmont Patent Data

Summarize Observations by Class: 
    See if this matches Giacomo's Table as an approximation
    If this doesn't work - construct a page-class mapping

Misc:
    Innovation or Development? What is a good framing? Perhaps both


# To do: 
    - Integrate border in geocoded Austrian patent
    - Clean Piedmontese Data
    - Brainstorm about DiD vs RDD estimates
    - Complexity as DV
    - 1878 pipeline: data -> OCR -> GPT -> Manual Correction
    - Reorganize data + scripts
        - See if we can spacially interpolate some control variables


- Market access: one way is just an empirical approach:
    - we collect city/municipality level data on the change in market access over time based on population counts of cities and distances
    - and use the railway network maybe
    - And based on diplomatic relationships to France/Switserland
    - If market access is so important, we compare East Lombardy vs West Lombardy. If the story about effort is correct, we should expect a higher increase in patenting on the east side.
    - What if we observe a negative effect? Local Market Access
