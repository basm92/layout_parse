# Notes Seminar AE

- Emmanuel: proximate vs. fundamental causes of ec. growth
- Maria: patent applications influenced by relative price difference. What are the explanations?
- Uli: Why would Austro-Hungarians go to Paris? Prohibitive costs
    - Could potentially also look at London or "neutral" countries
    - Countries less likely to be directly involved
- Empirical strategy slide: make clear that it is a municipal-level design
- Emmanuel: complexity question - is it sophistication of the product or the number of countries that matters? 
    - Complexity: country-level vs. municipal-level
- Trends: Veneto on steeper trend, implying any evidence in favor of Lombardy we find might be a lower bound
- Paul: What is the unit of analysis?
- Maria: Marco Martinez has patent data for a later period
- Sparse Data: 
    - Deal with many zeroes (Poisson regression maybe)
- Maria: patents vs. patents per capita can be huge
    - Look at a later census maybe
    - Aggregate to the region level or the distritto level
- Uli: intensive vs. extensive margin
    - Weighted regressions
- Paul: could this be a change in countries? You just lose your.. market access
    - We should control for that in some way
    - How about studying an effect "the other way around"? 
    - E.g. Nice and Savoie to France?
- Uli: war-related distruction
    - No artillery, likely neglible, but have to find out
- Relatively short timeframe: surprising to find effects on the short-term
    - Currently missing: why could that be? 
    - Which type of innovation and why? 
    - Distinguish between different inventors or maybe the same inventor!
    - More generally, look at individual-level information
    - Patents in German vs. in Italian 
- Invention vs. protection of invention
- Since when did the patent system exist in Italy vs. Austria? (Both 1848)
    - Check graph of evolution
    - But DiD so check differential trends in patents
- Uli: do we know for how long?
    - Not for Austrian, maybe for Italian via the Bolletino source
